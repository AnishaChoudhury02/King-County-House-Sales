### Distribution of house prices

In contrast, the lowest frequency was 1 for a price of $1,381,380, which was also the highest price in that particular graph. Similarly, lower frequencies were seen for houses that were the cheapest, for instance, at $106,260 to $177,100 (frequency=2).

The map is concentrated in King County and displayed by zip code using longitude and latitude coordinates. The lighter the colour the higher the average prices. For instance, the higher average price is of area with zip code 98039 at $1,317,500.

### View vs Condition heat map
Next to compare houses bought by people who consider the view (vertical) and condition(horizontal) of houses, a heat map is created. The values used is the average price (the darkest colour being the highest avg price and vice versa). From this we can interpret that the highest average price was for houses with excellent view and average condition at $959,333. The lowest price was of houses with fairly worn-out conditions and no views at $256,667.
